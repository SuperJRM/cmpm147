				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Randomly placed stars are created and added to a list, with the canvas rotating each frame, allowing them to be printed at
					different angles, simulating movement. As the mouse moves, the speed of the rotation accelerates by adding an acceleration 
					value to the rotation, allowing the stars to speed across the night sky and slow down over time. Trees are stored in a list 
					structure similar to the stars, however, they are drawn seperately, allowing them to keep their location on the canvas.
				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working with Tyler was fun, as it felt like we were able to consistently make progress
					together. In terms of my work, I came up with the starting framework and concept, however, the
					bulk of my work came later in improving the overall look and feel of the experiment, specifically with how the stars appeared 
					and moved across the sky. The highs came from how quickly we were able to create a nice looking experiment with our past p5.js 
					experience. The lows, however, definitely came from my busy schedule preventing me from doing as much work as I had originally 
					wanted. Despite this, I had a lot of fun with this project!</p>
