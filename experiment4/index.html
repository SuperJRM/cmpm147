				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Generates an infinitely explorable world of unique islands and a constantly changing ocean. 
					Search for treasure by clicking on tiles, and maybe you'll find a gold coin if you're lucky!

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical Description</h2>
				<p>We used the XXH32 hashing function, as well as p5.js's built-in noiseSeed and randomSeed methods,
					to generate the placement of various types of tiles over a grid. Depending on the values generated,
					the tiles will either take the form of a terrain tile or a shade of ocean, with the potential of 
					for a wave forming. Clicking the land will alter its appearance and have a cance to spawn a gold 
					coin. By placing these features within an infinitely generated landscape, not only will each
					user's journey be different depending on where they go, but also the seed their world is built 
					from, making for a truly infinite world.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Artist Statement</h2>
				<p>Infinity: 
					We used the infinite extent of the world to represent an endless landscape of a nostalgic open sea.
					
					Variation in Space: 
					As the audience browses the world, theyâ€™ll see numerous islands of varying shapes and sizes.
					Sandy banks and sea foam surround each land mass, with the larger islands being populated by grasses. 
					Orange ports invite voyagers to board these small worlds to explore and search for treasure.
					
					Variations in Key: 
					Different worlds will have different islands to explore, with new variations of islands and waves.
					
					Signs of Life: 
					Clicking tiles allows sailors to dig for treasure. During their search, the passage of time shifts
					the colors of the water, giving a shimmering effect, and bring about waves that lap at the land.
