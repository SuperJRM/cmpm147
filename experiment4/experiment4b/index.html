				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>Description: One of two generators, the worlds they generate are meant to mimic that of old Pokemon games, specifically Gold and Silver.
					This world uses a bright color palette, similar to those used to counter a dim Gameboy screen, to bring a spring, and maybe even winter, scene to life.
					
						--Codes:-- _ places down ground tiles, : places trees, and w creates tiles of water.
					
						--Life:-- In this world, streams and ponds move gently during the spring, with winter bringing the fall of powdered snow.
					
						(using tiles from [Micro Tileset - Overworld & Dungeon](https://thkaspar.itch.io/micro-tileset-overworld-dungeon) by [thkaspar](https://thkaspar.itch.io/))

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Autotiling was used to place down appropriate sprites, with noise randomizing which tiles were used. The water and snow use time passed to change sprites
					per second passed, mimicking animation.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Working on the project alone, I found building the generators to be a very fun experience.
					Having grown up with sprite based games, I thought it was really cool to actually make some
					kind of homage to them in a way. For that reason, I feel that the highs of the project definitely
					came from seeing everything in action. However, there were a lot of lows that came from
					technical issues. On top of the usual slew of bugs, I also had to deal with the constant crashing of
					Glitch during certain periods, where the site would break whenever any changes were made to
					the code. I also had an incredibly difficult time with fitting both generators into one portfolio
					page, to the point where I eventually gave up and just split the two. Overall, though, I am glad I
					was able to create something I am proud of, and that I was able to learn so much about autotiling!
